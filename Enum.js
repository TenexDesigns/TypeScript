Enums, short for enumerations, are a special data type in TypeScript that represents a group of named constants. Enums can be either numeric or string-based, and they are useful for defining a set of distinct cases or constants with a clear intention typescriptlang.org tutorialsteacher.com.

Numeric Enums:

Numeric enums are the default enum type in TypeScript. They assign numbers to each member, starting from 0 by default, or you can provide custom values for each member:

enum Direction {
    North = 0,
    East = 1,
    South = 2,
    West = 3
}
String Enums:

String enums assign string values to each member. They are useful when the value needs to carry a human-readable meaning, such as when reading the value in a log or error message:

enum CardinalDirection {
    North = 'N',
    East = 'E',
    South = 'S',
    West = 'W'
}
In this example, each direction has a letter value that indicates which direction it represents digitalocean.com.

Using Enums:

You can use enums to access their members and assign them to variables:

const myDirection: Direction = Direction.North;

if (myDirection === Direction.North) {
    console.log("You're heading north.");
}
Enums are a useful data structure for organizing constants and making your code more readable and type-safe. They are supported in TypeScript as a feature that extends JavaScript and can be used to define a set of named constants with numeric or string values typescriptlang.org digitalocean.com.

  Enums in TypeScript allow you to define a set of named constants. Enums provide a way to associate meaningful names with a set of values, making your code more readable and maintainable.

To define an enum in TypeScript, you use the enum keyword followed by the name of the enum and its values:

typescript
Copy code
enum Direction {
  North,
  South,
  East,
  West,
}
In this example, we define an enum called Direction with four values: North, South, East, and West. By default, the values are assigned numeric indices starting from 0. So, North has the value 0, South has the value 1, East has the value 2, and West has the value 3.

You can also assign specific numeric values to enum members:

typescript
Copy code
enum Direction {
  North = 1,
  South = 2,
  East = 3,
  West = 4,
}
In this case, North has the value 1, South has the value 2, East has the value 3, and West has the value 4.

Enums in TypeScript can be used in various ways. You can access the values of an enum using dot notation:

typescript
Copy code
let direction: Direction = Direction.North;
console.log(direction); // Output: 0

let oppositeDirection = Direction.South;
console.log(oppositeDirection); // Output: 1
You can also perform reverse mapping, which allows you to get the name of an enum member from its value:

typescript
Copy code
let directionName = Direction[2];
console.log(directionName); // Output: "South"
Enums can be used in switch statements for better readability:

typescript
Copy code
let direction: Direction = Direction.East;

switch (direction) {
  case Direction.North:
    console.log("Heading North");
    break;
  case Direction.South:
    console.log("Heading South");
    break;
  case Direction.East:
    console.log("Heading East");
    break;
  case Direction.West:
    console.log("Heading West");
    break;
  default:
    console.log("Unknown direction");
}
Enums can also be used as types in TypeScript:

typescript
Copy code
function move(direction: Direction) {
  // Code to move in the specified direction
}

move(Direction.West);
In this example, the move function takes a parameter of type Direction, which means it can only accept values that are members of the Direction enum.

Enums in TypeScript provide a convenient way to work with a fixed set of values, improving code clarity and maintainability by using meaningful names instead of arbitrary numbers or strings.
