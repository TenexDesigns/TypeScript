Sure, here is a summary of ambient declarations in TypeScript with code samples:

**Ambient declarations** are a way to tell the TypeScript compiler that the actual source code exists elsewhere. They are used to provide type information for JavaScript libraries or other external sources that are not written in TypeScript. This allows you to use these libraries in your TypeScript code without having to rewrite them in TypeScript.

**Defining Ambient Declarations:**

Ambient declarations are typically stored in separate files with the `.d.ts` extension. These files are not compiled to JavaScript, but they are used by the TypeScript compiler to provide type information.

**Syntax for Ambient Declarations:**

The syntax for ambient declarations is similar to the syntax for regular TypeScript declarations. However, there are a few key differences:

* Ambient declarations must use the `declare` keyword.
* Ambient declarations cannot contain implementation details. They can only contain type information.

**Example of an Ambient Declaration:**

The following code shows an example of an ambient declaration for the jQuery library:

```typescript
declare module jQuery {
  export function $(selector: string): any;
  export namespace ajax {
    export function get(url: string): Promise<any>;
  }
}
```

This declaration provides type information for the jQuery `$` function and the jQuery Ajax API.

**Using Ambient Declarations:**

To use an ambient declaration in your TypeScript code, you first need to reference the `.d.ts` file in your main TypeScript file. You can do this using the `/// <reference path>` directive.

```typescript
/// <reference path="jquery.d.ts" />

const $ = require('jquery');

const element = $('div');
console.log(element.text());
```

**Benefits of Using Ambient Declarations:**

* **Improved type safety:** Ambient declarations help to ensure that you are using JavaScript libraries in a type-safe way.
* **Better IntelliSense:** Ambient declarations provide better IntelliSense support for JavaScript libraries.
* **Easier integration with TypeScript projects:** Ambient declarations make it easier to integrate JavaScript libraries into TypeScript projects.

**Conclusion:**

Ambient declarations are a powerful tool for using JavaScript libraries in TypeScript projects. They provide type safety, better IntelliSense, and easier integration with TypeScript projects.
