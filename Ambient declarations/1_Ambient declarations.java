Sure, here is a summary of ambient declarations in TypeScript with code samples:

**Ambient declarations** are a way to tell the TypeScript compiler that the actual source code exists elsewhere. 
  They are used to provide type information for JavaScript libraries or other external sources that are not written in TypeScript.
  This allows you to use these libraries in your TypeScript code without having to rewrite them in TypeScript.

**Defining Ambient Declarations:**

Ambient declarations are typically stored in separate files with the `.d.ts` extension. These files are not compiled to JavaScript, but they are used by the TypeScript compiler to provide type information.

**Syntax for Ambient Declarations:**

The syntax for ambient declarations is similar to the syntax for regular TypeScript declarations. However, there are a few key differences:

* Ambient declarations must use the `declare` keyword.
* Ambient declarations cannot contain implementation details. They can only contain type information.

**Example of an Ambient Declaration:**

The following code shows an example of an ambient declaration for the jQuery library:

```typescript
declare module jQuery {
  export function $(selector: string): any;
  export namespace ajax {
    export function get(url: string): Promise<any>;
  }
}
```

This declaration provides type information for the jQuery `$` function and the jQuery Ajax API.

**Using Ambient Declarations:**

To use an ambient declaration in your TypeScript code, you first need to reference the `.d.ts` file in your main TypeScript file. You can do this using the `/// <reference path>` directive.

```typescript
/// <reference path="jquery.d.ts" />

const $ = require('jquery');

const element = $('div');
console.log(element.text());
```

**Benefits of Using Ambient Declarations:**

* **Improved type safety:** Ambient declarations help to ensure that you are using JavaScript libraries in a type-safe way.
* **Better IntelliSense:** Ambient declarations provide better IntelliSense support for JavaScript libraries.
* **Easier integration with TypeScript projects:** Ambient declarations make it easier to integrate JavaScript libraries into TypeScript projects.

**Conclusion:**

Ambient declarations are a powerful tool for using JavaScript libraries in TypeScript projects. They provide type safety, better IntelliSense, and easier integration with TypeScript projects.

  Ambient declarations in TypeScript are used to describe the shape and structure of existing JavaScript code, especially when integrating TypeScript with libraries or code that was not originally written in TypeScript. These declarations help the TypeScript compiler understand the types and signatures of variables, functions, and classes that exist outside the TypeScript codebase.

### *.d.ts Files:

- **Definition Files (.d.ts):**
  - Files with the extension `.d.ts` are called definition files in TypeScript. They are used to provide ambient declarations for existing JavaScript code.

### Purpose of *.d.ts Files:

1. **Type Declarations:**
   - They primarily contain type declarations, including interfaces, classes, functions, and variable types.

2. **TypeScript Compatibility:**
   - They enable TypeScript to work with JavaScript libraries and code by providing type information.

### How to Use *.d.ts Files in TypeScript:

1. **Reference in Code:**
   - Use the `/// <reference path="filename.d.ts" />` syntax at the top of your TypeScript file to reference the definition file.

   ```typescript
   /// <reference path="someLibrary.d.ts" />
   ```

2. **Include in tsconfig.json:**
   - Include the `.d.ts` files in the `files` or `include` section of your `tsconfig.json` if you are using TypeScript project configuration.

   ```json
   {
     "files": [
       "app.ts",
       "someLibrary.d.ts"
     ]
   }
   ```

### Example of Ambient Declaration:

Suppose you have a JavaScript library with the following code:

```javascript
// someLibrary.js
function greet(name) {
    return "Hello, " + name;
}
```

You can create an ambient declaration file to provide type information for this library:

```typescript
// someLibrary.d.ts
declare function greet(name: string): string;
```

Now, you can use this library in your TypeScript code:

```typescript
/// <reference path="someLibrary.d.ts" />

const result = greet("John");
console.log(result);
```

### What Goes in *.d.ts Files:

1. **Interfaces:**
   - Declare interfaces that describe the shape of objects or classes.

   ```typescript
   interface Person {
       name: string;
       age: number;
   }
   ```

2. **Functions:**
   - Declare functions and their signatures.

   ```typescript
   declare function greet(name: string): string;
   ```

3. **Variables:**
   - Declare global variables and their types.

   ```typescript
   declare const version: number;
   ```

4. **Classes:**
   - Declare the structure of classes.

   ```typescript
   declare class Car {
       start(): void;
       stop(): void;
   }
   ```

### Implementation in *.d.ts Files:

Typically, `.d.ts` files focus on declarations rather than implementations. They are meant to describe the types and structures without providing the actual implementation. If you need to include implementation details, you would usually do so in regular TypeScript files (.ts).

In summary, ambient declarations in TypeScript (.d.ts files) are used to describe the types and structures of existing JavaScript code. They are primarily focused on providing type information for TypeScript while interacting with non-TypeScript code. Implementation details are usually kept separate in regular `.ts` files.
