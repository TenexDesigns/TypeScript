In TypeScript, union types allow you to declare a variable that can hold values of multiple specified types. Union types are denoted using the pipe (|) character between the types. This provides flexibility in handling variables that can accept different data types. Here's an example:

typescript
Copy code
let value: string | number;

value = "Hello";
console.log(value.length); // Output: 5

value = 123;
console.log(value.toExponential(2)); // Output: 1.23e+2
In the above code, the variable value is declared with a union type of string | number, indicating that it can hold either a string or a number. The value variable is first assigned a string value, and the length property can be accessed because strings have a length property. Later, the value variable is assigned a number value, and the toExponential method can be called because numbers have that method.

Union types are useful in scenarios where a variable can have multiple possible types, and you want to allow flexibility in the assignment of values. It helps ensure that the variable is compatible with all the specified types in the union. TypeScript provides type checking and autocompletion based on the common properties and methods shared by the types in the union.

Union types can involve any number of types and can be used with primitive types, custom types, interfaces, classes, and more. For example, string | number | boolean represents a variable that can hold a value of type string, number, or boolean.

Using union types enables you to handle different scenarios where the variable may have multiple potential types, providing more expressive and flexible type annotations in your code.

Union types in TypeScript allow you to specify that a variable can have one of several possible types. They are useful when you want to allow a variable or function parameter to accept multiple types of values. Union types are defined using the pipe (|) symbol between the types tutorialsteacher.com, howtodoinjava.com.

Here's an example of using union types:

type StringOrNumber = string | number;

let value: StringOrNumber;

value = 'Hello'; // Allowed, since 'string' is one of the types in the union
value = 42; // Allowed, since 'number' is one of the types in the union
You can also use union types in function parameters and return types:

function formatValue(value: string | number): string {
  if (typeof value === 'string') {
    return value.toUpperCase();
  } else {
    return value.toFixed(2);
  }
}

console.log(formatValue('hello')); // HELLO
console.log(formatValue(42)); // 42.00
In the above example, the formatValue function accepts either a string or a number as its argument, and returns a formatted string. The function uses a type guard (the typeof operator) to determine the type of the input value and format it accordingly codecademy.com.
