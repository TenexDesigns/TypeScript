In TypeScript, variables can be declared using the `var`, `let`, or `const` keywords. TypeScript introduces static typing to JavaScript, allowing you to specify the type of a variable. Here's an overview of variable declaration in TypeScript:

### `var` Keyword:

```typescript
var variableName: dataType = value;
```

- **Scope:** Variables declared with `var` have function-level scope. They are hoisted to the top of their scope.
- **Reassignment:** Can be reassigned.
- **Declaration:** Can be declared without an initial value.
- **Hoisting:** Hoisted to the top of their scope.

### `let` Keyword:

```typescript
let variableName: dataType = value;
```

- **Scope:** Variables declared with `let` have block-level scope (scoped to the nearest curly braces `{}`).
- **Reassignment:** Can be reassigned.
- **Declaration:** Can be declared without an initial value.
- **Hoisting:** Hoisted to the top of their block.

### `const` Keyword:

```typescript
const variableName: dataType = value;
```

- **Scope:** Variables declared with `const` have block-level scope.
- **Reassignment:** Cannot be reassigned once initialized. The value is constant.
- **Declaration:** Must be initialized at the time of declaration.
- **Hoisting:** Hoisted to the top of their block.

### Type Inference:

In TypeScript, you can omit the type declaration, and the compiler will infer the type based on the assigned value:

```typescript
let x = 10; // TypeScript infers x to be of type number
```

### Union Types:

You can use union types to specify that a variable can have multiple types:

```typescript
let variable: number | string;
variable = 10;      // Valid
variable = "hello"; // Valid
```

### Any Type:

If you don't know the type of a variable in advance, you can use the `any` type:

```typescript
let variable: any;
variable = 10;      // Valid
variable = "hello"; // Valid
```

### Type Assertion:

You can use type assertion to tell the compiler that you know more about the type than it does:

```typescript
let variable: any = "hello";
let length: number = (variable as string).length;
```

These are some of the basic concepts related to variables in TypeScript. Understanding the type system and how to work with different variable types is essential for writing type-safe and maintainable code in TypeScript.
