In TypeScript, variable scope determines the accessibility and visibility of a variable within a program. TypeScript variables can have the following scopes:

1. Global Scope: Global variables are declared outside of any programming constructs such as functions, classes, or blocks. These variables can be accessed from anywhere within your code. For example:
   ```typescript
   let globalVariable = 10;

   function example() {
     console.log(globalVariable); // Output: 10
   }
   ```

2. Class Scope: Class variables, also known as fields, are declared within a class but outside of any methods. These variables can be accessed using an object of the class. Class variables can also be static, which means they belong to the class itself rather than instances of the class. Static class variables can be accessed using the class name. For example:
   ```typescript
   class MyClass {
     instanceVariable = 20;
     static staticVariable = 30;
   }

   let obj = new MyClass();
   console.log(obj.instanceVariable); // Output: 20
   console.log(MyClass.staticVariable); // Output: 30
   ```

3. Local Scope: Local variables are declared within programming constructs such as methods, loops, or conditional statements. These variables are accessible only within the construct where they are declared. For example:
   ```typescript
   function example() {
     let localVariable = 40;
     console.log(localVariable); // Output: 40
   }
   ```

It's important to note that variables with the same name can have different scopes. For example, you can have a global variable and a local variable with the same name, and they will be treated as separate variables within their respective scopes.

Understanding variable scope is crucial for managing the visibility and accessibility of variables in your TypeScript code. It helps prevent naming conflicts and ensures that variables are used in the appropriate context.
