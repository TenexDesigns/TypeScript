In the provided JavaScript code snippet, there is a distinction between `num_val` and `num_vals`. Let's break down the code to understand it better:

```javascript
class Numbers {
    num_val = 1333;

    constructor() {
        this.num_vals = 13;
    }

    storeNum() {
        var local_num = 14;
        return local_num * 2;
    }
}
```

1. **`num_val` and `num_vals`:**
   - `num_val` is declared as a class field using the class property initializer syntax. It's a field that is part of the class, and its value is assigned directly during the class definition.
   - `num_vals` is declared within the constructor using `this.num_vals`. This makes it an instance variable, meaning each instance of the class will have its own copy of `num_vals`.

2. **Class Fields vs. Constructor Fields:**
   - `num_val` is a class field, and its value is shared among all instances of the class. Any instance of the `Numbers` class will have the same value for `num_val`.
   - `num_vals` is an instance variable declared within the constructor. Each instance of the class will have its own unique `num_vals` with the value specified in the constructor.

3. **Constructor Significance:**
   - Fields declared within the constructor are typically used when you need instance-specific values or when you want to perform some initialization logic that depends on constructor parameters or other instance variables.
   - Fields declared outside the constructor (class fields) are shared among all instances of the class and are often used for constants or values that are shared across all instances.

In summary, `num_val` is a class field with a shared value among all instances, and `num_vals` is an instance variable with a unique value for each instance. The choice between class fields and constructor fields depends on the intended behavior and usage of the variables within your class.
