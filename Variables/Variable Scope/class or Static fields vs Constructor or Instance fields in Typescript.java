In TypeScript, class fields and constructor fields contribute to the distinction between instance variables and static/class variables.

Let's discuss the provided TypeScript code and how it translates to JavaScript (ES2015 or later):

```typescript
var global_num = 12; // global variable

class Numbers {
    num_val = 13;      // instance variable
    static sval = 10;  // static/class variable

    storeNum(): void {
        var local_num = 14;  // local variable
    }
}

console.log("Global num: " + global_num);
console.log(Numbers.sval);  // accessing the static variable

var obj = new Numbers();
console.log("Instance num: " + obj.num_val);  // accessing the instance variable
```

1. **Translation to JavaScript (ES2015 or later):**
   - The `class` syntax in TypeScript gets translated to JavaScript's prototype-based inheritance.
   - TypeScript class fields become properties on the class prototype, and constructor fields become properties on the class instances.

   The translated JavaScript might look something like this:

```javascript
var global_num = 12;

class Numbers {
    constructor() {
        this.num_val = 13;      // instance variable
    }

    storeNum() {
        var local_num = 14;      // local variable
    }
}

Numbers.sval = 10;              // static/class variable

console.log("Global num: " + global_num);
console.log(Numbers.sval);

var obj = new Numbers();
console.log("Instance num: " + obj.num_val);
```

2. **Explanation:**
   - `global_num` is a global variable and remains unchanged when used inside the class.
   - `num_val` is an instance variable, meaning each instance of the class has its own copy. `obj` is an instance, so `obj.num_val` refers to the `num_val` specific to that instance.
   - `sval` is a static/class variable. It is shared among all instances of the class and can be accessed using the class name (`Numbers.sval`).

3. **Static Fields in TypeScript:**
   - The `static` keyword in TypeScript is used to define static fields or methods that are associated with the class itself, rather than with instances of the class.
   - In the example, `static sval` is a static field, and it's accessed using the class name (`Numbers.sval`).

In summary, TypeScript provides a convenient way to declare instance and static/class fields within classes, and these fields have specific behaviors when it comes to their scope and accessibility. The translation to JavaScript reflects these distinctions.
