In TypeScript, array traversal refers to iterating through the elements of an array, and array methods are functions that can be applied to arrays for various operations. Below, I'll cover array traversal, common array methods, and their purposes:

### Array Traversal:

#### Using `for...of` loop:
```typescript
let numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

for (let num of numbers) {
    console.log(num);
}
```

#### Using `forEach` method:
```typescript
let numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

numbers.forEach(num => {
    console.log(num);
});
```

### Common Array Methods in TypeScript:

#### 1. `map`:
The `map` method creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the array.

```typescript
let numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3];
let doubledNumbers = numbers.map(num => num * 2);
// doubledNumbers is [2, 4, 6]
```

#### 2. `filter`:
The `filter` method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.

```typescript
let numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let evenNumbers = numbers.filter(num => num % 2 === 0);
// evenNumbers is [2, 4]
```

#### 3. `reduce`:
The `reduce` method applies a function simultaneously against two values of the array (from left-to-right) as to reduce it to a single value.

```typescript
let numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let sum = numbers.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => accumulator + currentValue, 0);
// sum is 15
```

#### 4. `some`:
The `some` method tests whether at least one element in the array passes the test implemented by the provided function.

```typescript
let numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let hasEven = numbers.some(num => num % 2 === 0);
// hasEven is true
```

#### 5. `every`:
The `every` method tests whether all elements in the array satisfy the provided testing function.

```typescript
let numbers: number[] = [2, 4, 6, 8];
let allEven = numbers.every(num => num % 2 === 0);
// allEven is true
```

#### 6. `indexOf` and `lastIndexOf`:
The `indexOf` method returns the first index at which a given element can be found in the array, and `lastIndexOf` returns the last index.

```typescript
let numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 5];
let index = numbers.indexOf(3);
// index is 2

let lastIndex = numbers.lastIndexOf(3);
// lastIndex is 4
```

These are just a few examples of array traversal and methods in TypeScript. Each method serves a specific purpose and can be used depending on the requirements of your code.
