Type aliases in TypeScript allow you to create custom names for types, making your code more readable and expressive. They provide a way to define reusable type annotations for complex types or to give descriptive names to existing types. Here's how you can use type aliases in TypeScript:

typescript
Copy code
type Point = {
  x: number;
  y: number;
};

function calculateDistance(point1: Point, point2: Point): number {
  const dx = point2.x - point1.x;
  const dy = point2.y - point1.y;
  return Math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);
}

const p1: Point = { x: 0, y: 0 };
const p2: Point = { x: 3, y: 4 };
console.log(calculateDistance(p1, p2)); // Output: 5
In the above example, a type alias Point is defined using the type keyword. It represents an object with x and y properties of type number. The calculateDistance function then uses this type alias for its parameters. It enhances code readability by providing a descriptive name for the parameter type.

Type aliases can also be used with union types, intersection types, function types, and more. They help make your code more modular and expressive by abstracting away complex types into reusable named entities.

typescript
Copy code
type ID = string | number;

type UserInfo = {
  id: ID;
  name: string;
  age: number;
};

function getUserInfo(id: ID): UserInfo {
  // ...
}
In the above example, ID is a type alias that represents either a string or a number. The UserInfo type alias represents an object with id, name, and age properties. The getUserInfo function uses the ID type alias for its parameter and returns a UserInfo object.

Type aliases are especially useful when you have complex or lengthy types that are reused throughout your codebase. They enhance maintainability, readability, and help reduce redundancy by providing meaningful names for types.

  Type aliases in TypeScript allow you to create a new name for a type, making code more readable and less repetitive [1]. A type alias can be used to assign a name for any type, including primitive types, object types, and union types. Type aliases do not create new types but provide a name for existing types [5].

Here's an example of a type alias for a custom type in TypeScript:

type User = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
};

const user: User = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 30
};
In this example, we define a type alias User for an object with name and age properties. We then use this type alias to create a new object user.

Type aliases can also be used with union types:

type MyType = string | number;

let myVar: MyType = "hello";
myVar = 42;
In this example, we define a type alias MyType for a union type of string and number. We then create a variable myVar of type MyType and assign it a string value "hello". We can then reassign myVar to a number value 42.

Type aliases are similar to interfaces in terms of syntax and behavior [7]. However, there are some differences between the two:

A type alias can be used to create a name for any type, while an interface is used to describe the shape of an object.
An interface can be extended or implemented by other interfaces, while a type alias cannot be extended or implemented.
An interface can have members added later on, while a type alias cannot be changed after being defined [7].
In conclusion, type aliases in TypeScript allow you to create a new name for any type, including primitive types, object types, and union types. They can make your code more readable and less repetitive. However, they cannot be extended or implemented and cannot be changed after being defined.
