In TypeScript, interfaces can be used in conjunction with classes to define a contract or blueprint for the structure and behavior of objects. Interfaces describe the public shape of a class, specifying the properties and methods that the class must have. By implementing an interface, a class ensures that it adheres to the defined contract. Here's how interfaces can be used with classes:

Implementing an Interface:
To implement an interface in a class, you use the implements keyword followed by the interface name. The class then provides implementations for all the properties and methods defined in the interface.

Example:

typescript
Copy code
interface Shape {
  calculateArea(): number;
}

class Rectangle implements Shape {
  width: number;
  height: number;

  constructor(width: number, height: number) {
    this.width = width;
    this.height = height;
  }

  calculateArea(): number {
    return this.width * this.height;
  }
}
In the above example, the Rectangle class implements the Shape interface by providing an implementation for the calculateArea method. The class ensures that it has the required method defined by the interface.

Extending Interfaces:
Interfaces can also extend other interfaces, allowing you to inherit and combine their definitions. This enables you to build more complex interfaces and create a hierarchy of contracts.

Example:

typescript
Copy code
interface Shape {
  calculateArea(): number;
}

interface SolidShape extends Shape {
  calculateVolume(): number;
}

class Cube implements SolidShape {
  sideLength: number;

  constructor(sideLength: number) {
    this.sideLength = sideLength;
  }

  calculateArea(): number {
    return 6 * Math.pow(this.sideLength, 2);
  }

  calculateVolume(): number {
    return Math.pow(this.sideLength, 3);
  }
}
In the above example, the SolidShape interface extends the Shape interface, adding an additional calculateVolume method. The Cube class implements the SolidShape interface, providing implementations for both calculateArea and calculateVolume methods.

Access Modifiers in Interfaces:
Interfaces can include access modifiers (public, private, or protected) for properties and methods. However, these access modifiers are purely for documentation purposes and do not enforce the access levels in the implementing class. The access modifiers are only checked during compile-time for class implementations, not for interfaces.

Example:

typescript
Copy code
interface Vehicle {
  brand: string;
  speed: number;
  accelerate(): void;
  brake(): void;
}
In the above example, the Vehicle interface defines properties brand and speed, as well as methods accelerate and brake. However, the access modifiers like public are optional and serve only as documentation.

Using interfaces with classes provides a way to define contracts, ensure consistency, and enforce type checking. It allows you to build more maintainable and reusable code by providing clear specifications for objects and their behavior.

In TypeScript, classes can implement interfaces to enforce a specific contract or structure. By implementing an interface, a class agrees to define all the properties and methods specified in the interface. This ensures that the class follows the expected structure and provides a mechanism for type checking typescriptlang.org logicbig.com.

To implement an interface in a class, use the implements keyword followed by the interface's name:

interface IUser {
    name: string;
    age: number;
    getFullName(): string;
}

class User implements IUser {
    name: string;
    age: number;

    constructor(name: string, age: number) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    getFullName(): string {
        return `${this.name}, ${this.age}`;
    }
}
In this example, the User class implements the IUser interface, ensuring that it defines the name, age, and getFullName properties and method. If the class does not implement all the required properties and methods, TypeScript will raise a compilation error typescriptlang.org.

You can also implement multiple interfaces in a single class by separating the interface names with commas:

interface IPerson {
    name: string;
    age: number;
}

interface IEmployee {
    empCode: number;
    getSalary(): number;
}

class Employee implements IPerson, IEmployee {
    name: string;
    age: number;
    empCode: number;

    constructor(name: string, age: number, empCode: number) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.empCode = empCode;
    }

    getSalary(): number {
        return this.empCode * 100;
    }
}
In this example, the Employee class implements both the IPerson and IEmployee interfaces, ensuring that it defines all the required properties and methods from both interfaces typescriptlang.org.
