Sure, here is a summary of modules in TypeScript with code samples:

Modules are a fundamental feature of TypeScript that allows you to organize your code into separate units. This can make your code more maintainable and easier to reuse.

There are two types of modules in TypeScript:

Internal modules: These are modules that are defined within a single file. Internal modules are now considered obsolete in favor of namespaces.

External modules: These are modules that are defined in separate files. External modules are the most common type of module in TypeScript.

To create an external module, you simply create a new file with a .ts extension. The file itself is the module, and any code written within the file belongs to that module.

To export members from a module, you use the export keyword. For example, the following code exports a function called greet from a module:

TypeScript
export function greet(name: string): string {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
Use code with caution. Learn more
To import members into a module, you use the import keyword. For example, the following code imports the greet function from the module defined above:

TypeScript
import { greet } from './greetings';

console.log(greet('John Doe'));
Use code with caution. Learn more
Modules can also export classes and interfaces. For example, the following code exports a class called User from a module:

TypeScript
export class User {
  name: string;
  email: string;

  constructor(name: string, email: string) {
    this.name = name;
    this.email = email;
  }
}
Use code with caution. Learn more
To import a class or interface into a module, you use the import keyword followed by the class or interface name. For example, the following code imports the User class from the module defined above:

TypeScript
import { User } from './user';

const user = new User('Jane Doe', 'janedoe@email.com');
console.log(user.name);
Use code with caution. Learn more
Modules can also export default values. For example, the following code exports a function called add as the default value from a module:

TypeScript
export default function add(x: number, y: number): number {
  return x + y;
}
Use code with caution. Learn more
To import a default value, you use the import keyword followed by the module name and an identifier. For example, the following code imports the add function as the default value from the module defined above:

TypeScript
import add from './math';

const result = add(5, 3);
console.log(result);
Use code with caution. Learn more
Modules are a powerful tool for organizing your TypeScript code. They can make your code more maintainable, easier to reuse, and easier to test.

Here are some additional code samples that demonstrate how to use modules in TypeScript:

TypeScript
// Define a module named 'shapes'
module shapes {
  export class
 
Circle
 
{
    radius: number;

    constructor(radius: number) {
      this.radius = radius;
    }

    getArea(): number {
      return
 
Math.PI * this.radius * this.radius;
    }
  }

  export class Square {
    side: number;

    constructor(side: number) {
      this.side = side;
    }

    getArea(): number {
      return this.side * this.side;
    }
  }
}

// Import the 'shapes' module and create a circle and square
import { Circle, Square } from './shapes';

const circle = new Circle(5);
const square = new Square(10);

console.log('Circle area:', circle.getArea());
console.log('Square area:', square.getArea());
Use code with caution. Learn more
This code defines a module named shapes that exports two classes, Circle and Square. The code then imports the shapes module and creates a circle and square object. Finally, the code prints the area of the circle and square.

I hope this summary is helpful. Please let me know if you have any other questions.
