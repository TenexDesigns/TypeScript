TypeScript modules are a way to organize and structure code in TypeScript. They allow you to encapsulate code into reusable and independent units, making it easier to manage dependencies and improve code readability and maintainability.

Here are some key points about TypeScript modules:

1. **Module Syntax**: TypeScript supports standard ECMAScript module syntax in TypeScript and JavaScript files, as well as some TypeScript-specific syntax extensions. You can use the `import` statement to import entities from other modules and the `export` keyword to expose entities from a module for use in other modules. TypeScript also provides a type syntax for dynamically importing module types without writing an import declaration[^1^].

2. **Module Resolution**: TypeScript uses module resolution to determine how to locate and load modules. There are different module resolution strategies, such as `node`, `classic`, `bundler`, etc. The module resolution strategy can be specified using the `--moduleResolution` compiler option. When using the `bundler` module resolution strategy, TypeScript resolves `import` statements but doesn't resolve `require` calls[^1^].

3. **Wildcard Substitutions**: TypeScript allows you to use wildcard substitutions in module path patterns defined in the `tsconfig.json` file. Wildcards can be used to match any string in the module specifier and substitute the matched string in the file path values. This feature is useful for creating path aliases and simplifying module resolution[^1^].

4. **Default Exports**: TypeScript allows each module to have one default export. The default export is marked with the `default` keyword. To import a default export, you use a different syntax than regular named imports. For example, `import defaultExport from 'module_name'`[^4^].

5. **Barrels**: Barrels are a technique used to roll up exports from different modules into a single module, usually named `index.ts`. Barrels simplify the import process by combining the exports of multiple modules into a single import statement. This technique helps improve the organization and readability of code[^5^].

To learn more about TypeScript modules and how to use them, you can refer to the official TypeScript documentation[^1^][^3^] and other helpful tutorials and guides[^2^][^4^][^5^][^7^][^9^]. These resources provide detailed explanations, examples, and best practices for working with TypeScript modules.
